# About

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game with opponent AI, backend scoreboard support and effects.

You can direct test the game from here.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
